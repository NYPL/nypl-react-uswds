# NYPL React Boilerplate

Isomorphic React boilerplate

The goods:

* ES6 - compile with Babel and Webpack
* Flux - [Alt](http://alt.js.org/) and [Iso](https://github.com/goatslacker/iso)
* Webpack-dev-server
* NYPL Header and Footer npm modules

### Usage
Clone the repo and run `npm install`.
Then run `npm run init` which will:
* remove the git reference and create a new one
* run through `npm init`. Do this to create a new repo name.

Then run `npm start` to start the local server at `localhost:3001`.


### Test

To run unit tests, run `npm test` in the terminal. Or run `npm run test-with-coverage` to run the test and see the test coverage.
